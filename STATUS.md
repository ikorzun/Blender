# BLENDO — current state

A short page to read from your phone. Updated at big milestones.
⚠️ PROJECT MEMORY (survives any chat): [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — all
decisions, bans and traps with their reasons; [WORKSTREAMS.md](WORKSTREAMS.md) —
a log of EVERY release with your specs verbatim; docs/ — plans.
A new session is required to read the canon first — that rule is in its header.

**Build: v2 = 541a24e (2026-09-03)** · the suite **940 checks, 0 red** · `main` and `v2` on GitHub
match · the live site verified byte-for-byte against the build · portal package **5.43 MB** of the
8 MB reference (headroom 2.57)

**Play from your phone:** https://ikorzun.github.io/Blender/ (debug: ?dev=1)

## What shipped 1–3 September

- **The full audit** you asked for: 8 finder lenses, two skeptics per finding, 34 findings survived —
  two real gameplay blockers fixed (the bomb destroyed the very block it had just thawed; the
  rescuer teleported a resting bomb because it read the dynamite as a sphere), plus the
  unshifted charge anchor, the painted-brick debris colour, and a tool that had checked nothing.
- **Ring accessibility samples fixed** (lifebuoy, donut): 6 of 8 origins used to sit in the hole;
  now 8 of 8, verified on a real level-39 Hard game — surgical, zero change to any other type.
- **The miss radius inverted on your word**: a mistake no longer drops the radius to 0.30; it
  now grows +0.05 per consecutive miss, stop at +0.20, always below the turbo ceiling 0.8, and any
  merge cancels the help. Measured: lv39 available pairs 3 → 4.
- **The props cadence restored**: 6, 9, 12 … 60, every gap exactly 3; nothing before level 51 moved.
- **Final screen**: the reward badge is a circle on one digit (36×36), the pills are circles.
- **Removed**: `07-matcap-bomb.js` (168 KB painting nothing) and the `release/` folder.
- **The Get More screen is ONE package** (3 September, your mock-ups 937:1505 / 937:1533): ×5 score
  for 30 min + 15 Shake's + 25 Tips for $1.99 — the three cards are gone, the bridge catalogue and
  the wrapper's id table carry `bundle5` alone (+ `noads_forever`).
- **Your four answers of 3 September are in:** 20 Gam stays; the ×5 budget counts ONLY play time
  (it stands still on the menu, on the win/lose screens, in the intro, with the tab hidden); no
  no-ads window anywhere; **ads only when the shakes and the tips have run out** — the interstitial
  between levels, the «📺 Continue» and the «×2 coins» rewarded buttons are removed.
- **Platform SDK (Playgama Bridge) 2.0.2 → 2.1.0** (3 September): the newest tag, checked the way the
  canon demands — the public surface of every module we use is identical, a live A/B on
  `?platform_id=playgama` is identical, the config untouched. The npm package is `@playgama/bridge`
  now; we stay on the vendored file (verified by byte size on the live site), not on the CDN.
- **Audio/** is the source of every sound: four folders, drop a file in and it reaches the game.

## Direction chats

All five (Physics, Story, Bridge, Interface, Graphics) are archived 2026-09-02 — their work is in
`v2` or superseded. Load-bearing branches stay on GitHub by name: `bonus-standalone`,
`matcap-bench`, `assets/models-in-game` (the only versioned copy of the models).
**Blendo SwiftUI** (the iOS wrapper) stays open: wrapper ads + `noads_forever` and the Xcode
payment tests are on it.

## What is waiting for YOUR actions (the pre-launch checklist is in the 2026-09-02 report)

1. Playgama dashboard — ONE product since 3 September: `bundle5` (Consumable) — the config
   charges **20 Gam** for it (= $2.00 at the fixed rate; the mock-up says $1.99, which is 19.9 Gam
   and GAM is whole — say «19» if you want $1.90 instead). Delete `bundle3` / `bundle2` there.
   App Store: `monster.blendo.bundle5` keeps its id, move its price tier to $1.99. The wrapper
   (Blendo SwiftUI chat): drop `monster.blendo.bundle3` / `bundle2` from its StoreKit product list.
   `noads_forever` only if you decide, and NOT Consumable.
2. Store listing: icon 1024×1024, cover 1920×1080 (+1080×1920), 4–6 screenshots.
   Texts are ready in `docs/STORE-LISTING.md`.
3. Ads in the iOS wrapper: ONLY the two rewarded offers (a shake / a tip when the stock is
   empty) — since 3 September there is no interstitial anywhere. `noads_forever` has nothing left
   to switch off: say whether to delete the product from the catalogue (it is dormant, no entry point).
4. Smoke test on developer.playgama.com after the upload — the only place where the ads are
   real, the purchase is real and the Safari bars are visible. Two things to watch there after
   the SDK 2.1.0 update: the curtain now shows Playgama's full logo (their new default), and the
   portal now receives our `level_completed` — make sure NO interstitial appears at all (we call
   none since 3 September; one would be the portal's own doing).
5. A `?fps=1` reading from your iPhone on level 39+ on Hard.

## Decisions only you can take

- Telemetry is OFF (`URL = ''`); switching it on is one line, and needs a privacy policy with it.
- `bonus.html` — the one Cyrillic file left: translate its branch, or drop it.
- `mat_cream` is first audible at level 87 — the order of TYPES is your lever.
- Story after level 37, dailies, localisation — planned AFTER the release.
